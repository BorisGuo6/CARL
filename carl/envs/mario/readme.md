# **CARL RNA Environment**

You'll need to follow some additional steps to install the Java backend for this environment. Be aware that Mario at this point will not run on any operation system besides Linux.

Make sure the submodules TOAD-GUI and Mario-AI-Framework are cloned and up to date. To be able to execute the environment, run:
```bash
javac carl/envs/mario/Mario-AI-Framework/**/*.java
```

TODO: this command produces and error with java 1.8 and 11, please specify java version if that's the issue (or jdk)
