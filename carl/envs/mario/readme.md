# **CARL RNA Environment**

You'll need to follow some additional steps to install the Java backend for this environment. Be aware that Mario at this point will not run on any operation system besides Linux.

To install ToadGAN:
```bash
cd carl/envs/mario
git clone https://github.com/Mawiszus/TOAD-GUI.git
cd ../../..
```

TODO: something is missing, please fix.
